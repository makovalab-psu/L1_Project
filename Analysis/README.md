###This repository contains the scripts and processed RData files for the following analysis

1. `Karyotype_plots`: Genome-wide visualization three L1 datasets (de novo L1s, polymorphic L1s, and human-specific L1s) included in the study
2. `Distance_distribution`: Distance analysis of L1 elements from the same dataset and elements from different datasets
3. `IWTomics`: Comparison of genomic landscape features related to L1 insertion and fixation via Interval-Wise Testing for Omics Data (IWTomics) 
4. `sFLR` and `mFLR`: Quantification of contribution from individual genomic features and their joint effect using single (sFLR) and multiple Functional Logistic Regression (mFLR) models 
5. `Additional analysis`: Analysis scripts and processed RData used to generate other relevant results in the study, for instance, the genome distribution of MspI and TaqI restriction enzyme sites
